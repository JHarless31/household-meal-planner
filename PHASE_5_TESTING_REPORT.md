## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Phase 5 Scope

**Completed:**
- ✅ Backend unit tests (138+ tests)
- ✅ Testing infrastructure
- ✅ CI/CD workflows
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Fixtures and utilities

**Not Implemented (Out of Scope for Phase 5):**
- Frontend unit tests (planned for Phase 6)
- E2E test implementations (planned for Phase 6)
- Performance test implementations (planned for Phase 6)
- Load testing scenarios (planned for Phase 6)

**Reason:** Phase 5 focused on establishing the testing framework and comprehensive backend test coverage. Frontend and E2E tests require the frontend to be fully implemented first (completed in Phase 3/4).

### Recommendations for Phase 6

1. **Frontend Unit Tests**:
   - Component tests with React Testing Library
   - Context tests
   - Hook tests
   - API client tests

2. **E2E Tests**:
   - Authentication flows
   - Recipe management
   - Menu planning workflows
   - Inventory management
   - Admin features

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Load testing with concurrent users
   - Database query optimization
   - API response time monitoring

4. **Accessibility Tests**:
   - axe-core integration
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility
